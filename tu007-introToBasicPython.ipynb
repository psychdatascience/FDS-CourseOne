    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language. Dynamically-typed means that we can define a variable, assign a value to it and we can then change the datatype associated with a variable. There are several built-in datatypes that are good to be aware of. This is good thing for us starting to work with the programming language because it makes the language less strict, easier to learn, although perhaps also more prone to potential mistakes and bugs. This is perhaps also one of the reasons why Python is so famous in data science and scientific programming. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using a dynamically-typed language we need to be aware of it because it will be possible to combine some variables safely but not others. If two (or more) variables have the same type (i.e., they are both integer, floats or imaginary) they can be combined safely and their combination will maintain the original type. If two (or more) variables are not the same type, combining them will change the type of the variable to the *more complex one*. \n",

Variabless are stored differently on your computer, some need less memeory than others. `Integers` need less memory to be represented than `Floats` and `Complex` need more memory then either of them. Python is smart (i.e., dynamically typed) so it can make an educated guess to how to combine into an output numerical variables of different type, yet, in doing so it will need to change the type of the output variables. The simplest type will be dropped and the more complex, or memory greedy type will be returned as the type of the output.\n",
