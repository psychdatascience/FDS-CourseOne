    "\n",
    "The most frequently used loop is the `for` loop, which allows us to do a computation a number of times. It can be used to do things like crawl through the rows and columns of a numpy array. With a pair of nested `for` loops, we can even crawl through each cell of an array in either row-major or column-major order. We could even use a `for` loop to chew through a series of data files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `while` loop is used when we don't know ahead of time how many times we'll need to do the calculation. The while loop allows us to compute or look at thing as many times as necessary until some condition as met. We just have to be careful that we don't make a dreaded *infinite* loop (what sort of cut off would make the `while` loop above essentially infinite?)."
