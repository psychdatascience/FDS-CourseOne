    "In \"tidy data\" terms, each column of a `DataFrame` should correspond to a variable, and each row should correspond to an \"observation\". So, for example, we might have 4 measurements (e.g. height, weight, BME, blood pressure) on a number of patients from a health clinic. In this case, we would make each patient be an \"observation\" and each column would contain a single variable, the kind of measurement. The pandas `DataFrame` object would easily allow us to compute, for example, the mean and stadard deviation of each measurement."
