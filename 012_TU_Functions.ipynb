    "2. **Global Namespace**: For now, think of the global namespace as just the set variables declared in the main body of the module script, outside any function.\n",
    "3. **Local Namespace**: This is the set of variable you declare *inside the function*. It is created when a function is called, and only lasts until the function finishes execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces in Python are created at different moments during code execution and have different lifetimes. For example, the built-in namespace is created when the Python interpreter starts up and remains until the interpreter quits. The global namespace for our script is created when we run our code, and the local namespace for a function is created when the function is called."

    "  - A module is a Python file that contains a collection of functions (it can contain other stuff too, but we don't need to worry about that now). It allows for good code organization and reusability, because we can put all our functions that, say, do some simple statistical calculations, into a single file. Then, we can use the functions whenever we need them, share them with collaborators, etc. \n",
